This Portfolio is no longer in use, a new one has been created to replace it. It is being kept active to show code and skill improvment.

### Overview
Create a personal portfolio with links for contact info, projects, GitHub, LinkedIn, Facebook, resume.  


### Explanation of Task
I used the knowledge that I've gained so far to start my Personal Portfolio.  I've also included ways to contact me as well as a picture.  There are links to my GitHub repositories as well as screenshots of some of the projects that I'm more proud of at this point in time.  This version is just the beginning version and will be updated many many times in the future as my knowledge level increases.

### Benefit of Personal Portfolio
Future employers and collaborators will want to look at my work and get a quick sampling of what I am capabale of. A personal portfolio does that.  At this time I have just created the first version. I intend to update it as I can to better showcase what I learn as I learn it.  

### Sources used for Pesonal Portfolio
This project allowed me to use a number of sources that I had never used before.
    For the color scheme I used www.schemecolor.com
    The resume was created at www.resume-now.com
    The logo and slogan were both created at www.brandcrowd.com


### Acknowledgments
I would also like to thank Chris Coyier at www.css-tricks.com for inspritation for the welcome screen and nav buttons.

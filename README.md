### Overview
Create a personal portfolio with links for contact info, projects, GitHub, LinkedIn, Facebook, resume.  


### Explanation of Task
I used the knowledge that I've gained so far to start my Personal Portfolio.  I've also included ways to contact me as well as a picture.  There are links to my GitHub repositories as well as screenshots of some of the projects that I'm more proud of at this point in time.  This version is just the beginning version and will be updated many many times in the future as my knowledge level increases.
